Run Notes:

1. 
- Completed WFT subtractions at 0934
-- 1_subrtact_WF.pdf
-- Pulls out the noise in the radar and subtracts it from the results (?) Confirm with someone

2. Calibration on 750 Cal
-- 2_cyl750_cal.pdf
-- jpegs not saving (?)

3. Calibration on 900 cal
-- have photo
-- 3_cyl_900_cal.pdf

4. Cyl mount 
-- have photo
-- 4_cyl_mount.pdf

5. Target Mount
-- Using same mount for all i hope
-- 5_tar_mount.pdf
-- starting POS 0.000
-- have photo
-- Looks fairly stable on the uncal'd chart over angle

6. Mini arrow target
-- using target mount from 5
-- have photo
-- starting at 0.000

7. Missile: nose 1
-- changing scan velocity from 0.235 to 0.220 to minimize motion on msl
-- msl was leveled by placing a 360 bubble on the nearest tail fin
-- msl must not be moved from test to test as much as possible
-- msl is placed at an azmuthal offset so that it seats cleanly in the mount
-- not zeroed!!! Must shift data (Should only be a few degrees though)

8. Missile: nose 2
-- Photo of missile and leveled fin
-- shifted missile body to level
-- Not zeroed!!! Must shift data

9. Missile: nose 3
-- Photo of missile and leveled fin
-- zeroed azimuth
-- radar temp == 68 deg F
-- Target appears to be roughly 33 degrees off center

10. Missile: nose 3
-- Redoing this measurement since i left the level on the fin!!!
-- same info as 9
-- did not zero az

11. Missile: nose 4
-- Rounded nose
-- did not zero az

12. Missile: nose 5
- semi-rounded nose
- did not zero az

13. Cal mount 2
-- second round measuring cal mount
-- Do not use. Use mount measurement in 16

14. Cal cyl750
-- moved mount. need to reshoot mount. 

15. Cal cyl900
-- 

16. Cal mount
